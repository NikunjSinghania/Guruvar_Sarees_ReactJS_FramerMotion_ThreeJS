Working remotely is of a great benefit as a person but with great beneifts there are some crucial issues that need to be discussed before uttering your opinion on Remote Working.

As of a question "Should employees be working remotely" , I think that working remotely is a really good idea as you can have your comfort with you and that can produce literally a great and comendable work that not only helps you but the organisation you are working for. Working remotely also gives you time for other aspects of your life like learning something new or engaging yourself in solial activity.

With no doubt, The COVID period boosted the hype of Remote Working before that there was no such great hype for that. Almost the whole worked for two years in a remote working module and this is a sharp proof that yes remote working is benficial and we can make great work while in that too.

But there is a crucial aspect which cannot be fulfilled by Remote Working module and that is Social growth and there is a lack of innovation in the remote working module. As working live give birth to ideas and that ideas are seeds of hope and innovation for society to grow and nurture.

In remote working module, Education is drastically effected as in that age your creativity takes a rapid growth and without friends and commucation that cannot be sprouted. 

At last I want to conclude that working remotely could be of great benefits but without Social growth there will be lack of maturity and that could be a posion for the era to come.
